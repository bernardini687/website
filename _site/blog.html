      </h4>
      <p><p>10 months ago I had no clue of how to achieve my goals. To be honest, I’m not quite there yet, but I’m now closer than ever.
This is not a rant about how to achieve goals. This is just another stranger on the web moulding just a few bytes into a personal story. Heck, isn’t this the beauty of the information era? And it’s really because of a story from a stranger on the web that, I dare to say, my life has changed.</p>
