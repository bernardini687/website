      <h1>Lessons Learned After 10 Months Of Coding</h1>
<p>23 Jul 2019 - </p>

<article>
  <p>10 months ago I had no idea of how to achieve my goals. To be honest, I’m not quite there yet, but I’m now closer than ever.
This is not a rant about how to achieve goals, this is just another stranger on the web occupying a few bytes to share a personal story. Heck, this is the beauty of this medium, right? And it’s because of a story from a stranger on the web that, I dare to say, my life has changed.</p>

<p>So, back to September 2018: I had the luck to be able to take a gap year which, at the time, was about to end. I spent the previous months doing some serious introspection and one of the first realizations I had was that my music-making pursuit wasn’t at all aligned with my values. Naturally, I fell into a mild quarter-century crisis.</p>

<p>I didn’t randomly pick the <em>quarter-century crisis</em> term, a similar phrasing was exactly what drew me to read a 59 minutes article on Medium, titled <em>How I landed a full stack developer job without a tech degree or work experience.</em></p>

<p>Now, I had no clue about what <em>full stack</em> meant, but <em>developer</em> was something that always fascinated me. In the past, I had my random moments where I would barely scratch the surface of what coding was, and they where interesting, but I’ve always had my music to focus on and that was already a difficult field not to fall into rabbit holes.</p>

<p>This time, though, it was different. I had nothing else holding me back from pursuing that interesting thing. For the first time in my life, I was not obsessed with something I did never question, I was strongly in need of pursuing a goal that would have lead me to a job I could enjoy and I had a clear idea of what my priorities and values were.</p>

<p>That was good enough. Good enough to give me a strong and growing momentum as I was reading through that stranger’s story. Good enough to make me apply to the same coding bootcamp he attended, which luckily enough had a branch also in Milan, not far from were I lived.</p>

<p>Questioning: does this really align? Why? What were my thoughts about it?</p>

<p>Freedom, breadth of possible fields/industries, remote work.</p>

<p>All-in mode. Serious prep-work.</p>

<p>Workshop, meet arbi, francesco and marco. Made my mind.</p>

<p>Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Between bootcamp 1 and bootcamp 2.</p>

<p>After bootcamp 2 - now.</p>
