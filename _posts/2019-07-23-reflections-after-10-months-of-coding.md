10 months ago I had no clue of how to achieve my goals. To be honest, I'm not quite there yet, but I'm now closer than ever.
This is not a rant about how to achieve goals. This is just another stranger on the web moulding just a few bytes into a personal story. Heck, isn't this the beauty of the information era? And it's really because of a story from a stranger on the web that, I dare to say, my life has changed.

So, back to September 2018: the end of my late gap year was approaching. I spent the previous months doing some serious introspection and one of the first realizations I had was that my music-making pursuit wasn't actually aligned with my values. Naturally, I fell into a mild quarter-century crisis.

I didn't randomly pick the _quarter-century crisis_ term, a similar phrasing was exactly what drew me to read a 59 minutes article on Medium, titled _How I landed a full stack developer job without a tech degree or work experience._

Now, I had no clue what _full stack_ meant, but _developer_ was something that has always fascinated me. In the past, I had my random moments where I would barely scratch the surface of what coding was, but I've always had music to focus on and that was already a huge amount of knowledge to handle.

This time, though, it was different. Without music as a professional goal, I had nothing else holding me back from pursuing that interesting thing. For the first time in my life, I was not obsessed with something I never questioned, I was strongly in need of pursuing a goal that would have lead me to an enjoyable job and I had a clear idea of what my priorities and values were.

That was good enough. Good enough to give me a strong and growing momentum as I was reading through that stranger's story. Good enough to make me apply to the same coding bootcamp he attended, which, luckily enough, had a branch also in Milan, not far from were I lived.

I saw training as a developer to be the goldend ticket to some kind of freedom: since IT is embedded in all kinds of industries, eventually I could have a degree of flexibility on where and with whom to work. My future became less of an unclear set of questions to which I had no answers, and I began to work on a daily basis toward my brand new goal of landing a developer job.

All-in mode, on. January 28th arrived quickly and the bootcamp begun. There's a lot to talk about that, but it's out of the scope of this post. Nine weeks flew by and I learned enough to be able to build a web application from scratch, from the back end to the front end, in collaboration with other students. Learning about programming, tools and best practices weren't the only values I got out those weeks. The humans there were simply amazing.

In such an environment, I felt empowered and supported. The momentum I cultivated in the preceding months simply spiked to levels I never dreamt of. I grew really passionate about programming because the staff there was capable of communicating the whole picture of what programming is about: a whole community of generous humans, sharing knowledge that's not only useful for being effective in the job but, really, in life. Programming is all about the mindset, and good mindset equals good life, I guess?

Dealing with frustration, solving problems, embracing patience and humility, being mindful and knowing when to take a break, learning how to learn and enjoying the process. All of these and a lot more are surprisingly related to programming, and with that being said, I ain't going anywhere else. This is where I belong.
